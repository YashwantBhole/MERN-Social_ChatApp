⚡ How It Works
💬 Real-time Messaging

Socket.io connects all users instantly.

Every message is broadcast live across clients.

🖼️ Image Uploads

Upload images ≤ 5 MB → sent to /api/upload.

Stored securely on Cloudinary → returned as an image URL.

Displayed instantly in chat.

🔔 Firebase Cloud Messaging

FCM initialized in both client & server.

Sends push notifications to all connected users (except sender).

Invalid tokens are auto-cleaned.

🗑️ Message Deletion & Metadata

Delete your messages (text/image).

Hover shows timestamp ⏰ + delete icon 🗑️.

📱 Responsive Design

Tailwind CSS makes the layout fluid across mobile & desktop.

Images and text scale beautifully with smooth animations.
